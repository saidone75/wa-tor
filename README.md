# Wa-Tor

A population dynamics simulation devised by A.K. Dewdney, loosely mimicking the [Lotka–Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations)

Based on [the original article](https://github.com/saidone75/wa-tor/blob/master/wator_dewdney.pdf) appeared on the December 1984 issue of Scientific American

## Usage

* spacebar or "two fingers tap" to pause/resume the game
* "C" or "swipe left" to clear the board and pause the game
* "R" or "swipe right" to reset the board with the current parameters
* "H" or "swipe up" to toggle the control panel
* "S" or "long touch" (> 2s) to show statistics

When paused click on a square to cycle between sea >>> fish >>> shark

From the control panel you can set the initial number of fish and sharks, their breeding thresholds, sharks lifespan without food and extra randomness for thresholds:
